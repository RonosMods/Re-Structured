# Re-Structured
This Datapack aims to add new structures to make the world more interesting to explore, tries to update old structures to fit in with the new building styles and makes them use new blocks and mechanics added by new minecraft versions.
# Jungle Temple
This new structure replaces the old jungle pyramid. I aimed to introduce new blocks that didn't exist back when the jungle pyramid was added and use blocks that we don't see very often in other structures. I always made sure to think about the lore and if the things i add make sense lore-wise. The structure consists of the above-ground part and a basement. The basement has 3 different layouts and it choses which one to use each time it generates. Inside the different basement types, there are more pieces that have multiple variations that the game choses from to randomize the temple even more. This ensures that the temple is different each time you find one cuz how many times do you find a jungle pyramid in a world anyways :). The description lists the numbers of all possible variations for all the randomizable pieces â†“.
## Lever Puzzle basement
The lever puzzle basement has the classic puzzle that the old jungle pyramid has.
### Currently has:
- 3 possible combinations for the lever puzzle
- 9 different decorative rooms
- 5 variantions of Reward rooms

After inserting the correct combination of the levers (there are 3 possible combinations so plyers have to try multiple combos instead of memorizing one), a piston door opens in the decorative room letting you into the reward room. The chests in decorative rooms have a different loot table from the reward rooms so reward rooms have better loot.
## Trapped basement
This basement type makes use of different challanges that you have to go through to get to the reward room.
### Currently has:
- 4 challange rooms containing different obstacles and challanges
- 5 different hallways
- 4 variations of Reward rooms

## Flooded Basement
The flooded basement consists of a pool and a tiny island with loot.
### Currently has:
- 5 different pool rooms
- 3 variants of mazes
- 6 decorative rooms
- 6 different reward piles

Here, you need to get across the pool to get to the reward island. The catch is that the pool is filled with pufferfish. There is also a hidden maze that is full of water so you have to solve it before you run out of air. There is a room with loot that is also an air pocket so you can breathe there.
## Future Plans for the Jungle Temple
- [DONE] New basement type with traps and obstacles like parkour
- Adding decorative pillars/ruins to spawn in the jungle biome
- Compatibility with Supplementaries. Using bamboo spikes and other redstone features it adds
- Compatibility with Alex's Mobs. Adding it's crocodiles/anacondas into the pool rooms
- Possibly compatibility with Ice & Fire. Adding it's gold and silver piles in reward rooms

I also want to add as many different mod compatibilities as possible, these are just the ones that i want to do most.
